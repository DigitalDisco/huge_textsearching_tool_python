# huge_textsearching_tool_python
A textsearching tool made which allows you to iterate huge pieces of text and find whatever you are looking for in an instant. Instructions are kept in a seperate readme file, but i would be more than happy to demo it for any companies dealing with huge chunks of data and/or data analysis (or are just interested in fun python code).
